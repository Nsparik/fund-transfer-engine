    # ── Trusted proxies (production load balancer / reverse proxy) ────────────
    #
    # When deployed behind a load balancer or reverse proxy (AWS ALB, nginx, etc.)
    # the real client IP is forwarded in X-Forwarded-For.  Without this setting,
    # $request->getClientIp() returns the LB/proxy IP — breaking rate limiting
    # and audit logging.
    #
    # REMOTE_ADDR trusts the immediately-connecting IP (the proxy itself).
    # Override with the actual proxy CIDR in production (e.g. '10.0.0.0/8').
    # See: https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html
